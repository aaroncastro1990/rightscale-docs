## Overview

This page describes how to install RightLink 10 on your custom images. RightLink has the ability to be installed at boot time using cloud-init. This workflow is recommended as it allows the usage of standardized images released by various vendors such as Canonical. However, RightLink can be pre-installed if needed on a freshly built or snapshotted image.

### Use-cases

Launching RightLink 10 enabled Servers without downloading and installing RightLink at boot time because of:
- Limited outbound connectivity
- Internal policy
- Lack of existing image options on a public or private cloud. For example, while Ubuntu images with cloud-init are generally available as they're provided by Canonical across the board, other operating systems may have [limited availability](/rl10/os_use_case_cloud_support.html).
- Need to use [Advanced networking for RCA-V](rl10_rcav.html) features. Software for this feature will automatically be installed with RightLink 10.2.0 and newer if VMware Tools or open-vm-tools are installed.

### Prerequisites

- Install script: root privileges, tar, and curl.
- RightLink itself: sudo and cloud-init. The standard OS cloud-init will usually work. However, for SoftLayer a custom cloud-init is required. See [Cloud-init Installation](rl10_cloud_init_installation.html) for details. Also, while cloud-init supports Azure, it will not currently work as the RightScale platform does not pass userdata in the correct format to be read by cloud-init.
- RCA-V images require VMware tools to be installed. Please see [RCA-V Image Requirements](/rcav/v3.0/rcav_image_requirements.html).

### Usage

rightlink.install.sh options are:
  ~~~
  $ script/rightlink.install.sh -h
  Usage: rightlink.install.sh [-options...]
  Installs/Upgrades RightLink on an an image.
    -l    create 'rightscale' user to enable managed login. disables if left off.
    -s    start rightlink service at end of this script
    -h    show this help
    -v    verbose mode
  ~~~

Example:
The following will install the latest GA RightLink on an Ubuntu image with managed login enabled. To install without managed login remove the -l flag:
  ~~~ bash
  apt-get -y update >/dev/null
  apt-get -y install cloud-init python-serial sudo
  curl -s https://rightlink.rightscale.com/rll/10/rightlink.install.sh |
    sudo bash -s -- -l
  ~~~

#### Installing Behind a Proxy

The `rightlink.install.sh` script performs a download of the installation files using wget/curl. Therefore, if running from behind a proxy, it is necessary to set the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables before running the script. Another option is to download the [installation package](https://rightlink.rightscale.com/rll/10.5.1/rightlink.tgz) and untar it and then run the `install.sh` script that is part of the tar file.

### Uninstalling RightLink Agent

rightlink.uninstall.sh options are:
  ~~~
  $ script/rightlink.uninstall.sh -h
  Usage: rightlink.uninstall.sh [-options...]
  Uninstalls RightLink.
    -f                    override command prompt confirmation for uninstall
    -v                    verbose mode
    -h                    show this help
  ~~~

The following example will uninstall RightLink from disk. -f means not to prompt for confirmation.
  ~~~ bash
  curl -s https://rightlink.rightscale.com/rll/10/rightlink.uninstall.sh |
    sudo bash -s -- -f
  ~~~
